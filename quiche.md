# Quiche
A basic quiche I make using leftover cheese.

## Ingredients
* 3 eggs
* 1.5 dl Kesella (quark)
* 2.5 dl Cream 
* Flour
* 150g Butter 
* Cheese
* Ham/Bacon/Broccoli/whatever filling you like

## Steps
1. Put oven to 200C
2. Melt butter, mix with flour and kesella.
3. Spread the dough into a pie form, and put the form into the oven for 10 mins.
4. While the dough is in the oven, whip the cream and eggs together. Grate the cheese and prepare other fillings.
5. Take out the form, but leave the oven on. Put cheese and fillings on top of the half-baked pie, then pour the cream and egg
mixture on top of the pie. Add pepper and salt as spices if you like.
6. Put the form back into the oven for 30 mins.
7. Take out, let it cool down a bit, then eat.
